            <h4>Estimate your user stories using the scrum poker technique even with remote teams!</h4>
            Typical workflow:
            <ul>
                <li>The organizer invites team players to a group</li>
                <li>The team players enter the group using their own devices</li>
                <li>The organizer provides a short overview of the user story and starts the game</li>
                <li>Each team player estimates the user story by selecting a card from the Fibonacci sequence</li>
                <li>The results are updated in realtime on all devices</li>
                <li>When the organizer decides that the time is up, he presses "View Results" and the estimates from all palyers
                    are displayed on all devices</li>
                <li>People with high estimates and low estimates justify their estimates and then the discussion continues</li>
            </ul>
